# üåå Project Unicode
Programs in various code - Unified

# ‚Ñπ About
**Project unicode** is a collection of programs written in various programming languages existing **since 1950's**. After discovering various programming languages which 
existed previously, i've got an idea to unify them. This repository consist of various folders with different programing problems, whose solution is expressed in 
programming languages given below(see [here](https://github.com/harishtpj/Project-Unicode#-programming-languages-used)). This project can help others to discover programming styles of various languages, which can also act as an guide to learn them, too.

# ‚öô Programming languages used
These programming languages are used to solve various programming problems:
1. C
2. C++
3. Python
4. Java
5. C#
6. JavaScript
7. Golang
8. Assembly Language(with various architectures)
9. Ruby
10. Rust
11. Perl
12. COBOL
13. Pascal
14. Kotlin
15. Prolog
16. QBASIC
17. SmallTalk
18. LISP
19. Ada

# ‚ùì How to use
The repository has folders named with the programming problem(e.g. `01-hello-world`). Clicking into those folders reveal the solution of the problem in various 
languages. These folders will also have a README file which explains the problem and the varous methods used to solve the problem in various languages.

# ‚úç Contributing
